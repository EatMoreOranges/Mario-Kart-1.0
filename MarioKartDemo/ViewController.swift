//        Each gesture recognizer knows the view it's attached to. We can ask the gesture recognizer (sender) for it's view in order to access the specific view that was panned (i.e. which kart image view).
//        ðŸ’¡ We're forcefully unwrapping the view property of the sender using a ! to avoid having to continuously account for it as an optional value. In our case, it's safe to do so since we can be assured that anyone calling this method will have a view attached and not be nil.

        //    â€¢ Move the cursor while continuing to hold the option key until the circles are close together.
        //    Now, Additionally hold down the shift key and move the two circles over the object you want to pinch.
        //    â€¢ Release the shift key, while continuing to hold the option key, click on the object you want to pan and (while continuing to hold the click) move the cursor to pinch in and out.
